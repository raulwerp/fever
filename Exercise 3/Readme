I was not able to create a pipeline. Don't have the required knowledge. From here, for the next steps, I work with datasets built in
Microstrategy from the provided files.

I did an ingestion script to load the files in a generic database (Ingestion.py) and to extract the plan_id from the campaign_name.

I include a query that would be used in the pipeline to load the tables. I use the f_w_coefficients table as example.
